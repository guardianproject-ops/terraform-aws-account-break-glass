description: Terraform module for managing an account dedicated to breaking glass

introduction: |-
  Emergency access processes must be designed for different failure modes that may result in an emergency event impacting access to cloud resources. Under normal circumstances, the Guardian Project's users federate to AWS using a centralized identity provider to manage their workloads.

  However, if the centralized identity provider fails, or the configuration for federation to AWS is modified, the workforce users may not be able to federate into AWS.

  An emergency access process allows authorized administrators to access cloud resources through alternate means, such as an alternate form of federation or direct user access, in order to remediate issues with the federation configuration or the workloads themselves. The emergency access process is utilized until the normal federation mechanism can be restored.

  This module implments the Guardian Project AWS Emergency Access Standard.

  - A dedicated AWS account, separate from all other accounts, must be created solely for the purpose of emergency access.
  - This account must not be used for any other purpose, that is, no workloads must be placed in this account except those facilitating the Break Glass procedure

  This module is responsible for creating the IAM users, IAM roles, and the monitoring/alerting resources necessary to implement the Standard.

usage: |-

  Prerequisites:

    - You have a break glass account provisioned and ready
    - This account is not used for any other purpose or workload

  This module consists of three modules:

  1. main module - applied to the break glass account
  2. regional module - applied to every active region in the break glass account
  3. target module - applied to accounts which you want to be able to break glass into

  The main module should be applied to the break glass account, it sets up the IAM users and login resources.

  The regional module must be applied against every active region in your AWS Organization (You do have an enforced, allowlist of AWS regions right?).
  This is **crucial** otherwise the Break Glass user signin alerts will not be sent.
  **NOTE:** One of your regions **must be**  `us-east-1` so that Event Bridge can capture the [Global Service Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html#cloudtrail-concepts-global-service-events)
  Alerting is supported via an email address, or you can pass in other types of subscribers such as webhooks.

  The target module should be applied to all accounts which you want to be able to break glass into. Take care to coordinate the role names across this main and target modules, there is an implicit link.


  ### Post Apply Steps

  - Onboard the users:
      - Setup their Password and MFA
      - Store the credentials securely in an offline environment
  - Create and maintain documentation that answer the questions:
      - When to declare a break glass emergency?
      - How to login to the break glass account with the emergency IAM users?
      - How to assume the break glass role into other accounts to perform emergency remediations?
      - How to "reset" the system after an emergency has been resolved?
      - How and when to test all of the above procedures?



  ```terraform
  provider "aws"{} # your main region
  module "break_glass" {
    source = "git::https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-account-break-glass?ref=main"
    context = module.this.context
    break_glass_users = {
      "joe" = {
        email = "joe@example.com"
      }
      "alice" = {
        email = "alice@example.com"
      }
    }
  }

  module "break_glass_region" {
    source = "git::https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-account-break-glass//modules/regional?ref=main"
    context = module.this.context
    alert_email_address = "security@example.com"
  }

  # in some other terraform run

  provider "aws" {
    region = "us-east-1"
  }

  module "break_glass_region" {
    source = "git::https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-account-break-glass//modules/regional?ref=main"
    context = module.this.context
    alert_email_address = "security@example.com"
  }
